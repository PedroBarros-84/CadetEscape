# Cadet Escape Game

### // Project Description  
Our first group project which took part in our 4th week at <Academia de Código_> #55 Bootcamp @ Lisboa.
We were challenged to create a game applying the technologies we had learned the previous weeks. Deadline for project deployment: 10 nights!

### // The Idea  
After our brainstorm we chose to create a game oriented at all the <Code_Cadets> from <Academia de Código_>.
The game revolves around our central character that tries to escape a rainfall of “summarizers” (these are daily homework assignments for presentation on the next morning; that usually results in the cadet going to bed after 4am).

### // Development  
First things first! Designing the UML schema for our project considering all of our game’s main features and creating a git repository. We implemented features one by one, (movement and collision, audio effects, graphic elements and user interface) mainly in pair programming, with extra details being coded individually.

### // Production  
After development, we compiled Cadet Escape into executables for the MacOS and Windows operating systems.
